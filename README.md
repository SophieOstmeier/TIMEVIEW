# Transparent Time Series

## Dependencies
You can install all required dependencies using conda and the following command
```
conda env create -n tts --file environment.yml
```
This will also install tts (the current module) in editable mode. This might be required for the notebooks to work. Otherwise there might be some problems with paths. 

## Example
Example is provided in notebooks/Visualize.ipynb
